      <p>Our research group work on practical applications of formal method to Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS). 
        We aim to propose formal methods and to develop verification tools to ensure the safety and reliability of ADS. The formal methods consist of a formal specification language, a control specification language, and formal verification methods using these languages.</p>
      <p>Toshiaki Aoki is the leading of the project.</p>
