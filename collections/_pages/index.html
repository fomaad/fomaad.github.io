    title: Formal Method and Autonomous Driving
    description_html: >-
      Our research group focuses on the practical application of formal methods to next-generation automotive systems, particularly autonomous driving systems. Our goal is to contribute to a safer, more reliable mobility society by setting new standards in the safety verification of these systems. Unlike existing research, which often addresses limited aspects or simplifies target systems, our comprehensive solutions target real-world autonomous systems, aiming to deliver not only robust methodologies but also practical frameworks and verification tools to be used in the autonomous driving sector.
