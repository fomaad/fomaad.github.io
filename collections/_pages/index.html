    title: Formal Method and Autonomous Driving
    description_html: >-
      Our research group work on practical applications of formal method to Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS). 
      We aim to propose formal methods and to develop verification tools to ensure the safety and reliability of ADS. The formal methods consist of a formal specification language, a control specification language, and formal verification methods using these languages. We propose the verification tools to support them as well. To this end, we have done and are involving several projects list below.
